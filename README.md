# Rock Paper Scissors

A Pokémon-inspired Rock Paper Scissors game, where you choose between one of the three first generation starters (Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle) to fight against the computer!

This is the first JavaScript project from [The Odin's Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) 'Foundations' Course, and no GUI was required on its first stage. We were later told to revisit the game and add an UI to it, and that's when I decided to change the concept.

I had some fun by changing the icon of the winning Pokémon to be a winking one, and also added some audios that play on game end. The last Pokémon that won (doesn't matter if it was yours or the computer's) will scream its name victoriously!
